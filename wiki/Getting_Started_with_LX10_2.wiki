===Step Two - Preparing your LX10===

----

We will now make sure your LX10 is ready to go!
<br />
  * Make sure the power switch on your LX10 is set to the "OFF" position.
  * Insert the battery securely into your LX10 with the correct polarity.
  * Plug the USB cable into your LX10 and into a free USB port on your computer.
  * Now you can turn your LX10 on!<br />

Your computer will now try to communicate with the LX10, unfortunately without the USB drivers installed it will fail!<br />
