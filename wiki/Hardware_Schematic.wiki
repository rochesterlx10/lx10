== Intro ==
This section shows the electronic schematic that was designed and used to create the LX10 along with a BOM (Bill of Materials).

Full PDF of the schematic can be found [http://lx10.googlecode.com/files/ODC_LX10_11_6_12_PCB_VP.PDF here].


== Schematic ==

The Top Level shows how each functional block interconnects with the others.
It also shows how the World connects to the PCB; in this case the World is the computer, which is plugged in to the USB socket (PL1). We also have the programming edge connector, represented by test points named EDGE_XXX.

Sheet 2 - LED Array Functional block - Shows how the LED array connects together. The anode of each LED in a row connects to the others in that row. The cathode of each LED in a row connects to the others in that column.

Sheet 3 - LED Drive circuit - this controls the the switching on and off of the LEDs.

Sheet 4 - Power functional block; this block shows how all the power is generated. This is done using a DC/DC Converter to take 9V in and convert to 3V3.

Sheet 5 - Microprocessor (Brain) Functional Block. This schematic shows the *PIC32* microprocessor and how we have connected it up to the switches, non volatile memory (Flash) and Touch Pads (for buttons A,B,X).

== Datasheets ==

Datasheets hold all of the technical data and parameters for the components used. Each component is normally supplied with its own datasheet, which is custom to each part. These are used by engineers to choose the correct part for the right job.
