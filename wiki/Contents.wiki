# = Introduction =

The BAE Systems Rochester Open Day 2012 is a day for family and friends of BAE Systems employees to see the work that the employees do at Rochester. The LX10 is an electronic giveaway product that has been developed by Graduates and IPs to support this effort, to demonstrate the product development processes undertaken to deliver a safe product. The key areas in developing the LX10 can be seen by navigating through the wiki.

Here you will also find other useful links such as an area for apps and games that you can download to your LX10. Or if you're feeling creative then a guide is also available to help you to develop your own app/game. And if you are interested in entering our competition then look for the link at the bottom of this page!
