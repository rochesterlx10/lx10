=Getting Started With Your LX10=

----

Since you are reading this I can safely assume that you have found our website! The instructions below will take you from unboxing your LX10 right through to opening up the LX10 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where you can write code to program onto your board. The instructions and screenshots have been created for Windows 7 but the process should be similar on any Windows installation.

*Note: The LX10 IDE will only run on a windows based computer as it uses the programming language Visual Basic and Microsoft's .NET v4.0 framework.*

Once you have downloaded both these ".zip" files you will need to open them up and extract them to a folder of your choice. Remember where you put them though as we will need them shortly! If you are unsure how to extract the files, or where to extract them to then just copy the screenshots below:<br />
