=Getting Started With Your LX10=

----

Since you are reading this I can safely assume that you have found our website! The instructions below will take you from unboxing your LX10 right through to opening up the LX10 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where you can write code to program onto your board. The instructions and screenshots have been created for Windows 7 but the process should be similar on any Windows installation.

*Note: The LX10 IDE will only run on a windows based computer as it uses the programming language Visual Basic and Microsoft's .NET v4.0 framework.*

===Step One - Downloading the LX10 IDE and USB Drivers===

----

Click on the links below to download the LX10 IDE and USB Drivers:<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/lx10">LX10 IDE</a><br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/lx10">LX10 USB Drivers</a><br />
Once you have downloaded both these ".zip" files you will need to open them up and extract them to a folder of your choice. Remember where you put them though as we will need them shortly! If you are unsure how to extract the files, or where to extract them to then just copy the screenshots below:<br />

===Step Two - Preparing your LX10===

----

We will now make sure you LX10 is ready to go!
<br />
  * Make sure the power switch on your LX10 is set to the "OFF" position.
  * Insert the battery into your LX10 and make sure it won't fall out.
  * Plug the USB cable into your LX10 and into a free USB port on your computer.
  * Now you can turn your LX10 on!<br />

===Step Three - Installing the USB Drivers===

----

Bare with us through this part, it is quite a lengthy process but if you follow the steps carefully you shouldn't have a problem.<br />
Your computer will now try to communicate with the LX10, unfortunately without the USB drivers installed it will fail!<br />

<font size="3">*Here's how to fix it:*
<br />
  * To install the drivers, go to the start menu in the bottom left of your computer and click on "Control Panel".<br />

----

  * Then click on "Hardware and Sound". If your screen differs to the screenshot below then look for something called "Device Manager" instead. If "Device Manager" is there, click on that, you can then skip the next step.<br />

----

  * Simply click "Next" button and the driver will attempt to install, however you will be met with a <font color="red">*BIG RED*</font> warning message as shown below:<br />

----

  * This sort of message is usually a cause for concern and if you see it when installing other devices be sure to check that you trust the source of the drivers! If you trust us, click on "Install this driver software anyway.png". You have now successfully installed the USB drivers for your LX10.<br />

----

  * You may close that message box by clicking on the "Close" button. You should now see a little message appear in your system tray (bottom right of your screen) which informs you that the device has been installed successfully.<br />

----

  * Do not worry if your device has a different COM port number, e.g. those brackets may say (COM1). This is just the address that your computer has assigned to the LX10 and can be different for each computer. You can now browse to your LX10 IDE installation folder and run "LX10_IDE.exe" to begin programming!<br /></font>
