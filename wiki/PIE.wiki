= The Pie Language =

== What is it? ==

Pie is a programming language made especially for your LX10. It is designed to be simple and powerful and to help people who new to programming to learn the basics. That's where we got the name, Programming Is easy, it's as easy as pie.

== Writing Pie code ==

First, you will need the [IDEUserGuide IDE] (Integrated Development Environment, but ignore that - lets just call it the IDE) which can be found on the [Downloads] page. 

You will need to use it in the Advanced mode and now you're free to write whatever Pie code you want! You can simulate it like it's on the board and when you're ready - program it to your device.

== Why would I want to? ==

Other than having the power to tell your board what to do, we will be holding a [LX10_Programming_Competition competition] for the best program made using the pie language where the winner could receive Â£30 of vouchers! Now that's got to be worth a try. All details [LX10_Programming_Competition here]
