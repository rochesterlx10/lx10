#summary This page explains the games and programs which you should have installed at the open day.

= Open Day Games Package =
Each game is programmed into a slot, selectable from the menu when you turn the device on.

The main menu is navigated with the left and right dpad buttons and you press A to select that game.

Once in a game, hold the X button for 1 second (not too long) and let go. This will return to the main menu.

The Pie code files for these can be found on the [Downloads] page called "First 10 Programs".

== Slot 5: Turbine ==
