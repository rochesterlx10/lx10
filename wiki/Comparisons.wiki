#summary PIE Function : Comparisons

= PIE Function : Comparisons=

Comparisons are used by [http://code.google.com/p/lx10/wiki/IF_function IF] and [http://code.google.com/p/lx10/wiki/While WHILE] conditional functions.

There are four different types of conditional functions:
  * Equal to / not Equal to
  * Greater than / Less than
  * LED is / LED was
  * Button is / Button is not

== Equal to / not Equal to ==

Used to test if a variable is equal to or not equal to another variable or number.

=== Example ===

<font color = "blue">if</font> x <font color = "brown">is</font> <font color = "orange">equal to</font> 3 <font color = "blue">then</font>

== Equal to / not Equal to ==

Used to test if a variable is equal to or not equal to another variable or number.

=== Example ===

<font color = "blue">if</font> x <font color = "brown">is</font> <font color = "orange">equal to</font> 3 <font color = "blue">then</font> <br>
<YOUR CODE GOES HERE> <br>
<font color = "blue">end if</font>

<font color = "blue">if</font> x <font color = "brown">is</font> <font color = "orange"> is not equal to</font> 3 <font color = "blue">then</font> <br>
<YOUR CODE GOES HERE> <br>
<font color = "blue">end if</font>


== Conditions ==

== Conditions ==
  * Equal to
  * Not Equal to
  * Greater than
  * Less than
  * LED is on/off
  * LED was on/off
  * Button <button name> is/not pressed

For more information on each of the conitions go to the [http://code.google.com/p/lx10/wiki/Conditions conditions page].

== Example ==


<font color = "blue">make</font> x 

<font color = "blue">set</font> x <font color = "blue">to</font> 4




<font color = "blue">if</font> x <font color = "brown">is</font> <font color = "orange">equal to</font> 3 <font color = "blue">then</font>

<font color = "blue">set</font> x <font color = "blue">to</font> 9


<font color = "blue">end if</font>

After this program has finished running x will be set to 4. This is because the IF command tested if x was equal to 3. The result was false because x was actually 4. Because of this '<font color = "blue">set</font> x <font color = "blue">to</font> 9' was not run and x was not changed to 9.
