#summary PIE Function : While

= PIE Function : While =

The WHILE function works in a similar way to the IF function. Except, instead of seeing whether something is true or not (like the IF statement), it tells the program to run a certain code while something is being/not being done.

== While Example ==

This will continually run the code at <YOUR CODE GOES HERE> while the b-button is pressed

<font color = "blue">do</font><br> below <font color = "blue">while</font><br> b-button <font color = "blue">is</font><br> pressed
<YOUR CODE GOES HERE> <br>
<font color = "blue">end do</font>
