  # When the LX10 is pluged in this screen should change to "Connected" and the program button should no longer be greyed out.
  # Click the program button and wait 10 seconds, your LX10 will be programmed with the default settings and applications
  # When you first power off and back on your device you will need to run a little test. This requires you to press Up, Down, Left, Right, X, B, A and then X again. In that order.
