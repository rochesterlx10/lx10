#summary Charlie Board

=PCB Prototype AKA Charlie=

After thorough testing and evaluation of our previous 2 prototypes we did a final full PCB prototype. This was to check that all circuitry would work properly with no thermal heat spots, no high density of current in places and to make sure communication between the devices was working fully.

Below shows a very basic PCB that is just FR4 and copper with no solder mask or silkscreen. We had this produced by Spirit Circuits using their "go naked" service; more info can be found [http://www.spiritcircuits.co.uk/services/go-naked here], and a video clip showing the process can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hgsShwfVRA here].
