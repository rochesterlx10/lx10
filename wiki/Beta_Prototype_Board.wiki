#summary Beta Board

=Beta Prototype Board=

After the first prototype was made, we re-designed the parts that we weren't happy about and created our beta prototype. This consisted of a PIC32, LED matrix/drive tile and accellerometer tile. 

The LED tile has a 10x10 matrix (100 LEDs) along with the row and column drive chips.
The accellerometer is the little tile at the bottom left that has the sticker on it. The accelerometer measures gravity in 3 axis, this allows you to work out in what direction the board is tilted.

This board doesn't have a USB tile like the Alpha prototype, this is because the PIC32 we used has a built in USB drive module allowing it to talk directly to a PC.

The LED drive tile was made using a homemade PCB; we made a PCB ourselves as it is the quickest way to connect such a large number of components - it would be very difficult to hand wire 100 LEDs together.
