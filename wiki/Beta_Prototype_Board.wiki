#summary Beta Board

=Beta Prototype Board=

After the first prototype was made, we re-designed the parts that we weren't happy about and created our beta prototype. This consisted of a PIC24, USB to UART converter and a LED drive tile. 

The LED drive tile was made on PCB; we did this to test the 10x10 LED array and make sure we had no issues with the PCB side of things.

The PIC24 was used as we realised we needed more programming memory for all the functionality we wanted.

An image of the beta prototype is shown below:
