#summary Beta Board

=Beta Prototype Board=

After the first prototype was made, we re-designed the parts that we weren't happy about and created our beta prototype. This consisted of a PIC32, LED matrix/drive tile and accellerometer tile. 

# The LED tile has a 10x10 matrix (100 LEDs) along with the row and collum drive chips.
# The accellerometer is the little tile at the bottom left that has the sticker on it. The accelerometer measures gravity in 3 axis, this allows you to work out in what direction the board is tilted.

This board doesn't have a USB tile like the Alpha prototype, this is becasue the PIC32 we used has inbuilt usb allowing it to talk directly to a PC

The LED drive tile was made using a homemade PCB; we make a PCB ourselves as it is the best way to connect such a large number of components, it would be impossible to hand wire 100 LEDs together.
