===Step Three - Installing the USB Drivers===

----

Please bare with us through this step, it looks like quite a lengthy process but if you follow the steps carefully you shouldn't have a problem and you'll be surprised at how quick it actually is.<br />

Your computer will now try to communicate with the LX10, unfortunately without the USB drivers installed it will fail!<br />

<font size="3">*Here's how to fix it:*
<br />
  * To install the drivers, go to the start menu in the bottom left of your computer and click on "Control Panel".<br />

----

  * Then click on "Hardware and Sound". If your screen differs to the screenshot below then look for something called "Device Manager" instead. If "Device Manager" is there, click on that, you can then skip the next step.<br />

----

  * This sort of message is usually a cause for concern and if you see it when installing other devices be sure to check that you trust the source of the drivers! If you trust us, click on "Install this driver software anyway". You have now successfully installed the USB drivers for your LX10.<br />

----

  * You may close that message box by clicking on the "Close" button. You should now see a little message appear in your system tray (bottom right of your screen) which informs you that the device has been installed successfully.<br />

----

  * Do not worry if your device has a different COM port number, e.g. those brackets may say (COM1). This is just the address that your computer has assigned to the LX10 and can be different for each computer. You can now browse to your LX10 IDE installation folder and run "LX10_IDE.exe" to begin programming!<br /></font>
