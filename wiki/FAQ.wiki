=== Q. What's this random dot on my screen when I turn my LX10 on? ===
A. This is the built in test - it should only appear once after the LX10 is restored to it's default settings. To get past this and return to the menu simply press Up, Down, Left, Right, X, B, A and then X again. In that order. If this screen keeps coming up then please [mailto:rochester.lx10@gmail.com contact us].

=== Q. My LX10 just shows "BAE" when I turn it on. How do I fix this? ===
A. The default settings must not have been put on at the open day. Luckily you can do this yourself using our [Batch_Programmer 'Factory' Defaults program].

=== Q. I found a bug, can you fix it? ===
A. We can't fix it until we know about it. Please [rochester.lx10@gmail.com contact us] with details.
