#summary Shows Images Created of PCB Design & Links to PCB Manufacturing Files



=PCB Design Tool Exports=

The images below show what the PCB design of the LX10 looks like. It shows the copper traces and fills (that current flows through to make connections between devices; aka Signals/Tracks). 

Shows Silkscreen Layer; white text which goes on top of the PCB. This shows part reference numbers and information the designer has put on there.

Pads are also shown (exposed areas of Gold/Nickel plated copper) to which the components are soldered to.

===Images=== 
Light Cyan - Pads of copper where components will be placed

Blue - Copper traces and fills

Red Writing - Silkscreen (writing on top of board)



Top side of the board - the side with all the components and LEDs on.

Bottom side of the board - this side doesn't have any components fitted to it or soldered to it. It mostly consists of 0VL ground fill with a few linking traces.

=Using CAM tools to interact with Gerber files=

This allows you to look at the raw data file which was sent to our PCB supplier [http://www.invotecgroup.com/html Invotech] to produce the board.

Gerber files can be found [http://lx10.googlecode.com/files/LX10.gwk here].

You can then download a free gerber viewer tool such as [http://www.graphicode.com/GC-Prevue#download GC-Prevue].

Once installed, right click on the file and open in GC-Prevue.

This will open up the PCB design that was sent to be manufactured. 

The PCB is manufactured in batches of 4, this is called a biscuit. This is done to reduce waste material and make smaller PCBs easier to handle.
