= Introduction =

Thanks for trying out our new language simulator. Please email Mark with any name ideas for the language.


= Language =

== Comment ==
{{{
@ comment goes here
}}}
== Make Variables == 
By default, a variable is a number.
{{{
make <variable> 
make <variable> a number
}}}
== Set Variables == 
Calculation is covered in the next section.
{{{
set <variable> to <number>
set <variable> to <variable>
set <variable> to <calculation>
}}}
== Calculation ==
{{{
<variable> + <number>
<variable> - <number>
<variable> * <number>
<variable> multiply <number>
<variable> / <number>
<variable> divide <number>

<variable> + <variable>
<variable> - <variable>
<variable> * <variable>
<variable> multiply <variable>
<variable> / <variable>
<variable> divide <variable>
}}}

You will need to put a calculation at the end of a set. For example:
{{{
set myVariable to var1 + var2
}}}
== Increment/Decrement == 
{{{
add <number> to <variable>
take <number> from <variable>

add <variable> to <variable>
take <variable> from <variable>
}}}
== Random ==
{{{
set <variable> to random number
}}}
== If statement ==
The `<comparison>` part is covered in the next section. There are many different types of ifs.
{{{
if <comparison> then
    <code>
end if
}}}
== Comparison ==
=== Variable Comparison ===
{{{
<variable> is equal to <number>
<variable> is not equal to <number>
<variable> is greater than <number>
<variable> is less than <number>

<variable> is equal to <variable>
<variable> is not equal to <variable>
<variable> is greater than <variable>
<variable> is less than <variable>
}}}
=== Button Comparison ===
{{{
a-button is pressed
a-button is not pressed
}}}
Possible buttons are:

 # a-button
 # b-button
 # up-button
 # down-button
 # left-button
 # right-button
=== LED Comparison ===
Was checks the last time the screen was updated. It's useful for collision detection.
{{{
led <variable or number>,<variable or number> is on
led <variable or number>,<variable or number> was on
led <variable or number>,<variable or number> is off
led <variable or number>,<variable or number> was off
}}}
== Loops ==
{{{
do below while <comparison>
    <code>
end do

do below forever
    <code>
end do

do below <number> times
    <code>
end do

do below <variable> times
    <code>
end do
}}}
== LED Control ==
This sets the LEDs on and off behind the scenes, but you won't see them change until you type "update display". There is a "set led (x,y) on now" function coming which will stop you needing to do that.

*User LEDs haven't been implemented yet.*
{{{
set led (<variable or number>, <variable or number>) on
set led (<variable or number>, <variable or number>) off

set all led on
set all led off
}}}

Set all led off is very useful for clearing the display.
== Draw ==
Same with LED control, "update display" will need to be typed after the draw in order for the screen to show the changes. For the numbers and arrows, `<location>` and `<direction>` are covered in the next sections.
{{{
draw number zero <location>
...
draw number nine <location>

draw smiley
draw bae

draw arrow <direction>
}}}
== Location ==
{{{
left
middle
right
}}}
== Direction ==
{{{
up
down
left
right
}}}
== Update Display ==
This must be done after any LED control in order to see a change
{{{
update display
}}}
== Wait ==
{{{
wait <number> seconds
wait <number> mseconds

wait <variable> seconds
wait <variable> mseconds
}}}
== Program Control ==
*These are not implemented yet.*
{{{
restart program
reboot
main menu
}}}
